Developers can develop and add new assets through an open plugins system keeping the wallet lightweight. The second component is a validator hosted on the Safenetwork. Users will connect to the Safenetwork through the wallet to exchange. An application will match the orders issued by the users and check all transactions and order informations are valid. Unlike centralized and semi-centralized exchanges, there isn’t a wallet acting as a relay. Transactions are processed simultaneously through an order matching engine from one wallet to another. The validator on the Safenetwork will check if the transactions are valid prior to being exchanged. The orders are then matched and transactions broadcasted in their respective networks.

Here’s a quote from Daniel Larimer, the founder of Invictus Innovations -BitGold is lent into existence like a Gold Bank Note from back in the day. When you went to get a mortgage on your house you promised to pay the bank 100 oz of Gold and pledged your house as collateral. In exchange the Bank promises to pay you 100 oz of Gold On Demand by either giving you bank notes or a balance in your checking account. They never actually gave you the gold you supposedly borrowed from the bank and instead played a fancy game of IOU swapping. An IOU from the bank is worth more than a personal IOU and therefore the bank charges you interest. The bank also demands collateral because they need to have the ability to make good on their IOU or there will be a bank run. Namely, if you don’t pay the bank is still solvent so long as the collateral can be seized and sold to cover the loan.",

The Ripto Bux team aims to create as many applications as possible that will utilize $RBX.
